# Web Design

# Video website

For this course I have made a video website, on which you can watch YouTube video's. You can filter the content to your liking. The website is built for a couple of specific persons, including [Marie](#marie).

# Feedback

## Points of attention

There was too much distraction from the main content of the site. The main content of the site, being the YouTube videos, did not get enough space and attention.

## Updated version

I remove a large part of the website and a large part of the styling. I did this in order to improve the visual hierarchy from the ground up. I split the remaining parts of the website in different parts so I could make the flow more apparent and give each part of the site a good hierarchy.

# Content inventory

- Introduction
- Content filter page
- Overview of filtered Youtube video's
- Video page
- Information per video

# User story

- When a (deaf) user visits the website, they understand what the website has to offer, so they can start using the website as quickly as possible.


# Marie

Marie is a web designer. Marie is also deaf.
Marie is one of two people this website is being build for. Recently we had the opportunity to get some insights from her. There are a couple of things deaf people find important on the web. Sign-language is the first language for most deaf people, including Marie. Sign-language has a different vocabulary to 'regular' language. Here are some of the insights Marie gave:

- Marie prefers short sentences. This makes it easier to understand what the text is about.
- Marie prefers the content to be 'To the point'. She want to understand what the website is about as quickly as possible. She is not looking for sweet-talk, it has to be direct.
- Marie prefers emotion through text, rather than through color or any other potentially distracting aspect of design.

# Todo

- [] Add an introduction to the website to provide more context for the user.
- [] Add more ways to filter content.
- [] Re-add the search function.
- [] Add more information to the video pages such as subtitles, discription.
- [] Re-add styling elements.
